My contribution to my hackathon group - making data visualisations

Competition website: https://www.dataanalytics2018.com/
Competition questions and the dataset is not included in this repository. 

My group didn't win. There were 47 registered groups, 30 of which submitted a solution. Only the top five get to present.

I have yet to learn to develop my own machine learning model as I have yet to study that field.
On hindsight, I could be of better use in a team focused on the foundations, and focus on understanding the data. 
It was possible to get into the finals without any use of machine learning libraries.
Nevertheless, I hope I have contributed significant value in the executing the data visualisations.
